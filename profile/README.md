Welcome to the official HoneyCore organisation ðŸ‘‹

HoneyCore is an ambitious project created by one man that aims to make learning computer science easier and free.
## The goal:
The goal is to make en entire ecosystem dedicated to make learning easy for everyone at any level. That's not clear ? Let me give you examples:

A kid doing his first steps in computer science, interested in making a simple snake game could use the entire package (i.e. HoneyCore CPU and motherboard architecture, HoneyOS and Python) to focus on what is really important at the moment.

But if at one point said child wants to learn how to code an OS or a kernel he could deactivate HoneyOS and starts writing his own OS based on the HoneyCore CPU architecture. Or even enable some modules but not others depending on what he wants to learn.

This is the spirit of HoneyCore, make extremely modular code so everything works flawlessly even when modules are deactivated to make learning easy and interesting by doing things.

## The projects:

You'll find below a list of all the projects we're currently working on or will be working on in the future:
- HoneyCore CPU:  CPU architecture we're working on.
- HoneyCore VM:  Since I'm alone on this adventure and don't have money to afford a real CPU then I'm doing it virtually
- HoneyCore assembler:  Assembler allowing to write assembly on the HoneyCore CPU (and virtual machine)
- HoneyCompiler: C Complier for the assembler (because writing assembly is fun but time consuming)
- HoneyOS:  Official operating system to run on the HoneyCore CPU
- HoneyOS kernel:  Kernel for HoneyCore OS
To see more details about a particular project see its dedicated repository.

## How to contribute:

I have to say I never did Open Source before, I'm still a student so just send me a mail or message and we'll figure things out, I really want to work with people to improve the code !
